# FlashCoffeeApp
FlashCoffeeApp is an online ordering system where Flash employees can order beverages of their choice online and come to pick them up at the coffee bar counter when they are ready.
The main purpose of this project is to reduce the waiting period at the bar and enrease productivity. For example, one person drinks three coffees a day. And each time they come for a cup of coffee they wait for their coffee for  5 to 10 mins, thus in a day its more or less 30mins that is lost by one employee per day, and everyday we have more than 100 coffee drinkers in the office.
